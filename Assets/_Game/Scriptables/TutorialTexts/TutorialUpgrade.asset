  - Enemies drop currency that you need to pick up to use.
  - You now have enough money for an upgrade tower, buy it at the core!
  - When placed, these towers have an aura that boosts your turrets.
  - Similar to the core, if you go near an upgrade tower, you can increase its level...
  - ...which increases the stat bonus it gives.
  - Lastly, the core keeps growing, and with it its area, good luck and don't let
    them corrupt it!
