  - Something dropped from the enemy, go pick it up.
  - Money! You have enough for an upgrade tower, go buy one.
  - When placed, these towers upgrade your turrets in their proximity.
  - When you go near an upgrade tower, you can increase its level...
  - ...which increases the stat bonus it gives.
  - Finally, the core keeps growing, and with it the area you need to protect, good
    luck!
