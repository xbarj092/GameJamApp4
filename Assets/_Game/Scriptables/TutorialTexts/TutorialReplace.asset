  - An enemy! They're trying to get to your core.
  - If an enemy gets to the highlighted area around your core, it will corrupt it!
  - And the core will start to collapse as it can't handle too much corruption.
  - You can pick a tower up by clicking on it [LMB]
  - ...move the held tower...
  - ...and place it by clicking on a spot you like [LMB] (or the highlighted one
    as that's where the enemy is coming from)
